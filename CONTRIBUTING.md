We greatly welcome contributions to benchmark results.

To add evaluation results of new models, simply

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add model information in `model_url_map.json` and evaluation results in `results.json`. Note that the model names in the two files should match.
3. Create a pull request. Please describe your evaluation environment (OS & software versions, hardware specifications, etc.).
